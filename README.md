This project aims to explore different statistical techniques and models to analyze and interpret data. The notebooks are organized as follows:

1. ARIMA Model:
- Time series analysis using the ARIMA model.
- Steps include data preprocessing, model fitting, and forecasting.

2. Linear and Lasso Regression:
- Implementation of linear and lasso regression models.
- Includes data splitting, model training, and evaluation.

3. Statistical Calculations and Plotting:
- Calculation of basic statistical measures: mean, mode, median, and Simple Moving Average (SMA).
- Visualization of data through various plots.
